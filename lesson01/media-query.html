            <h2>Alme 36:19-21</h2>
            <p>19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my apains bno more; yea, I was harrowed up by
                the
                memory of my sins no more.<br>

                20 And oh, what ajoy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as
                exceeding as was my pain!<br>

                21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains.
                <br>Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and
                sweet as was my joy.

            <p>7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded,<br>
                for I know that the Lord giveth no bcommandments unto the children of men,<br>
                save he shall cprepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>
